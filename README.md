# Titanic-Disaster-Classification
To classify the survivors and non survivors of the Titanic disaster.  The work is done as project of PGP course. 
The data is obtained from Kaggle and classification models like KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Ensemble model of LR, KNN and DT was used to classify the survivors and non survivors of the disaster.
Among these models random forest model classified the survivors and non survivors with better accuracy.
